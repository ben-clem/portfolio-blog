[DuckDuckGo] - it is my personal favourite search engine, and has grown to more and more popularity over the past few years. It has a squeaky clean reputation when it comes to privacy, and it does not sell your data (like Google, Bing, and countless others). It is also open-source, and community driven.

Here are a list of some easter eggs, fun, and silly [DuckDuckGo] tricks/tips.

# **Tips/tricks**

A few awesome tips and tricks to either try out something silly, or to make your life easier.

## !Bang

Just type in "!" infront of a search to open up that website, listed are a few examples

- !devto (opens Dev)
- !mdn (opens MDN Web Docs)
- !yt (opens YouTube)

...and so on, so forth. For a list of all all of these "bangs", visit [here]

## See social media information in results

Just type in "@" infront of a user or organization, and watch the [magic]

## Generate lorem ipsum text

Just type in "lorem ipsum" in the browser.

## Change casing

Not the most useful feature, but it exists. Just type in lowercase or uppercase in-front of your search and it will turn in into [upper] or [lower] case.

## Generate passwords

Type in "password 50" or any other number, and it will automatically generate a secure password for you!

## Generate passphrases

If those weird characters like "iCNqGvco43" are too hard to remember for you, which, in all fairness should be, then you can generate a passphrases using "random passphrase" and maybe find something a bit easier to remember :D

## URL encoding

You can type in "url encode" in-front of a URL to [encode] it!

## Expand links

With [DuckDuckGo], you can just type in "expand" in-front of a shortened link and it will expand it for you!

## Shorten links

Just like you can expand links, you can shorten them too! Just type in "shorten" infront of your link :D

## Cheatsheets

Add in "cheatsheet" at the end of your search to pull up a [cheatsheet]

## Searching for any calendar

Typing in "calendar" will bring up a simple, boring calendar. Though [DuckDuckGo] can do so much more. Type in calendar followed by the date (so for example, calendar 17 August 1345) and it will pull up a calendar from [there]

## Generate QR Codes

Add "qr" and then a link and watch it generate a [QR code]

## Find HTML codes

Typing in ["HTML chars"] will bring up HTML codes for special characters!

## Find colour codes

Type in ["color codes"]

## Find certain colours

You can search up a [colour code], and DDG will tell you what the colour is/looks like.

(Thanks to the awesome people in the comments for pointing this one out :wink:)

## Binary conversion

Just type in binary, and add "decimal" at the end for it to convert binary into decimal!

## Check the status of a website

Add in "is down?" at the end of your search to get the [results]

# **Easter eggs**

## [Why should I use this?]

## [Raccoon]

## [Hamburger]

## [Cuil]

## [xkcd]
