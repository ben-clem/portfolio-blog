2021 was an amazing and a not-so-amazing here. Some really good and bad things happened during it, growing me as a person.

As the year has ended and we're onto 2022, I wanted to take a second back and reflect on the past year.

2021 was a crazy year (to say the least). I managed to make myself slightly less stupid as a person. With school becoming more taxing amongst other things, I've had less time to code and contribute to open-source. With that to say, I'd like to express my gratitude all the people who've helped me get here. Thank you!

Wishing everyone the best of luck for 2022! Cheers üçª
