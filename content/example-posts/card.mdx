I was looking around GitHub the other day, and I found this awesome idea by [Anmol Singh] on creating a npx card to introduce themselves. I thought it was a cool idea, so I made one for [myself] too!

You can hit `npx harsh-dev` (or `pnpx harsh-dev` since [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) is better) in your terminal right now to learn more about me :wink:

# End result

# Setting it up

Let's create a new project

```bash:terminal
mkdir npx-card
cd npx-card

# Initialise yarn
yarn init -y

# For NPM
# npm init -y
```

Now let's install some needed [NPM modules](https://npmjs.com)

```bash:terminal
yarn add boxen chalk clear open inquirer

# For NPM
# npm i boxen chalk clear open inquirer
```

Making things easier on ourselves, let's also add in [nodemon] for reloading on save.

```bash:terminal
yarn add nodemon -D

# For NPM
npm i nodemon --save-dev
```

Let's go to the scripts section in our package.json and setup [nodemon]

```json:package.json
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon card.js"
  },
```

...and let's start!

```bash:terminal
yarn dev

# For NPM
# npm run dev
```

in our `card.js` file, let's import the [NPM modules](https://npmjs.com)

```js:card.js
const boxen = require('boxen')
const chalk = require('chalk')
const inquirer = require('inquirer')
const clear = require('clear')
const open = require('open')

// clear the terminal before showing the npx card
clear()
```

Now, let's create a new prompt. We can do this using [inquirer](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js#readme).

```js:card.js
const prompt = inquirer.createPromptModule()
```

Let's create a new JavaScript object with our prompt questions.

```js:card.js
const questions = [
  {
    type: 'list',
    name: 'action',
    message: 'What do you want to do?',
    choices: [
      {
        // Use chalk to style headers
        name: `Toss an ${chalk.bold('email')}?`,
        value: () => {
          open('mailto:example@example.com')
          console.log(
            '\nLooking forward to hearing your message and replying to you!\n'
          )
        },
      },
      {
        name: 'Exit',
        value: () => {
          console.log('Good bye, have a nice day!\n')
        },
      },
    ],
  },
]
```

Let's create another new JavaScript object, this time with data about us.

You should play around with this for a little bit to get the spacing right, having properly centred the fields.

I'll just post mines here, as an example.

```js:card.js
const data = {
  name: chalk.bold.green('                     Harsh Singh'),
  handle: chalk.white('@harshhhdev'),
  fact: chalk.hex('#B10000')('I love Open-Source!'),
  twitter: chalk.hex('#00A1D9')('https://twitter.com/Harshhhdev'),
  github: chalk.hex('#787878')('https://github.com/harshhhdev'),
  dev: chalk.hex('#330093')('https://dev.to/harshhhdev'),
  dribbble: chalk.hex('#AB009C')('https://dribbble.com/harshhhdev'),
  website: chalk.hex('#00AB9E')('https://harshhhdev.github.io'),
  npx: chalk.hex('#A1AB00')('npx harsh'),

  labelFact: chalk.hex('#FF6262').bold('          Fun Fact:'),
  labelTwitter: chalk.hex('#629DFF').bold('        Twitter:'),
  labelGitHub: chalk.hex('#9E9E9E').bold('         GitHub:'),
  labelDev: chalk.hex('#A959FF').bold('           Dev:'),
  labelDribbble: chalk.hex('#F259FF').bold('       Dribbble:'),
  labelWebsite: chalk.hex('#59FFC8').bold('        Website:'),
  labelCard: chalk.hex('#FFF976').bold('                  Card:'),
}
```

Now, let's create a our card using box.

We will use values from above and plug them into it.

```js:card.js
const me = boxen(
  [
    `${data.name}`,
    ``,
    `${data.labelFact}  ${data.fact}`,
    ``,
    `${data.labelTwitter}  ${data.twitter}`,
    `${data.labelGitHub}  ${data.github}`,
    `${data.labelDev}  ${data.dev}`,
    `${data.labelDribbble}  ${data.dribbble}`,
    `${data.labelWebsite}  ${data.website}`,
    ``,
    `${data.labelCard}  ${data.npx}`,
    ``,
    `${chalk.bold("Hi there! I'm Harsh, I'm a passionate MERN stack ")}`,
    `${chalk.bold('developer and web designer from India, and have a ')}`,
    `${chalk.bold('hobby for creating beautiful, cool, and responsive ')}`,
    `${chalk.bold('web apps. Toss me an email if you want to collab!')}`,
  ].join('\n'),
  {
    margin: 1,
    float: 'center',
    padding: 1,
    borderStyle: 'single',
    borderColor: 'blue',
  }
)

// Show the boxen
console.log(me)
```

We're almost finished! Let's make sure that we handle the prompt properly.

```js:card.js
prompt(questions).then((answer) => answer.action())
```

Now, let's move onto publishing

Create an account on [npmjs](https://npmjs.com/)

Make sure that you are logged on into npm. If you aren't, then do

```bash:terminal
yarn adduser

# For NPM
# npm adduser
```

Now, patch the version

```bash:terminal
# Make sure your git working directory is clean!
git commit -a -m "made my npx card"

# Update the version
yarn version

# For NPM
# npm version patch
```

Let's publish to [npmjs](https://npmjs.com/) now!

```bash:terminal
yarn publish

# For NPM
# npm publish
```

If everything is published, then try to execute the script using [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx)(or my personal favourite, [pnpx](https://pnpm.io/pnpx-cli))

```bash:terminal
# Try out mines using npx harsh-dev!
npx your-pkg
```

If you had any problems, feel free to drop me a DM on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/harshhhdev/), or ask away in the comments below!

With that, I want to thank [Anmol Singh] for this cool idea and the permission to write a post on it.

If it helped you out, I'm glad :heart: have a nice day!
