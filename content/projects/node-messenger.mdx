[FireChat](https://github.com/ben-clem/node-messenger) is a project I realized in 2020 for a course I was following at [ECE Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_centrale_d%27%C3%A9lectronique). This course was taught by [David Worms](https://github.com/wdavidw), CEO of Adaltas, and its goal was to introduce us to Web Technologies through labs on different topics of the JavaScript environment:

- Node.js
- Express
- SQL & NoSQL databases
- React (JSX, Function Components, Hooks)
- Material Design & Material UI
- OAuth & OpenID Connect

Each module had its own lab and we then implemented what we had learned on our semester project. You can find the content of this course on [this repo](https://github.com/adaltas/ece-webtech-2022-spring). I did this project in collaboration with my friend [Marin Neyret](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marin-neyret-664b9b142/), who I thank for his work.

The goal of this project was to build a basic messaging web app. You can find the full project requirements [there](https://github.com/ben-clem/node-messenger/blob/master/INSTRUCTIONS.md).

User can change its randomly generated username and his avatar. Avatars are being fetched from Gravatar or selected from a list, I didn't have time to implement uploading your own.
