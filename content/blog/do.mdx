So, recently DigitalOcean App Platform Hackathon was just announced on [Dev](https://dev.to/).

I thought I'd put together this list of things of which I think will be helpful resources for anybody partaking in this.

# Background

From 10 December 2020, to 10 January 2021, DigitalOcean App Platform Hackathon will be going on. You'll have a chance to win some cool prizes for building an application using DigitalOcean's new App Platform.

There are for categories, which are

- Personal Site/Portfolio
- Build an application related to mental health.
- Build something that could become commercial and earn big bucks
- Build a wacky app that doesn't fit into any of the categories above.
