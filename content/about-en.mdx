I am currently a graduate student at **Boston University** where I am pursuing a [Master of Science in Computer Information Systems](https://www.bu.edu/met/degrees-certificates/ms-computer-information-systems/).

I will be graduating in August 2022 and I am actively seeking a position as a **Software Engineer, under F-1 OPT status, starting in September 2022**.

# Bio

I come from France, more precisely from Paris, where I grew up.\
After high school, I was accepted at the [ECE Paris graduate engineering school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_centrale_d%27%C3%A9lectronique) to do a **Master of Science in Engineering**. I started by following a general education of **Mathematics**, **Physics**, **Electronics**, and **Computer Science**, during which I went from vector analysis, to thermodynamics, to graph theory, and many others.\
I learned programming in **C**, **C++**, **Java**, **JavaScript**, and **Python**, in that order, and I liked it a lot. I then specialized in **Information Systems**, **Big Data & Analytics**, and **AWS Cloud Architecture**.

This school has given me many opportunities over the years.\
I was first selected to go to **San Francisco** for two months in my second year, to participate in a program whose goal was to explore the link between Art and Engineering. There, [I created a piece of technological art with my team](https://benclem.dev/blog/SF), which we then presented in an exhibition (ours is called "Breakthrough" and features random light programming that spreads across the ceiling at an unpredictable frequency).\
In my third year, I was able to go and study abroad for a semester at the **Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey**, where I mainly focused on **Web Design** and **Computer Vision**.\
Finally, I was selected to pursue a **double degree at Boston University** through a partnership with my school, which financed half of the tuition costs.

In parallel to this, I had several opportunities to work and apply my programming skills.\
I started with a **Java Developer internship** at Opsomai, where I designed a desktop app that I delivered on macOS and Windows.\
I then worked as a **Web & Mobile Developer** at [IDEMIA](https://www.idemia.com/) for 5 months, during which I developed a device fleet monitoring web app in **JavaScript** with **React**, which I then integrated into an **Android** mobile app.\
Finally, I joined [the junior enterprise of my school](https://jeece.fr/), and I worked for them on a mission to develop a **React Native mobile app** for a human services company.
